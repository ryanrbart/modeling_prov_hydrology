# README modeling_prov_hydrology

This Github repository contains the data and code used to examine how hydrologic benefits are partitioned after forest thinning to the remaining unthinned trees and to streamflow.

Results from the analysis are associated with manuscript “How thinning overstocked forests benefits both forest health and streamflow” by Bart, Ray, Conklin, Safeeq, Saksa, Tague, & Bales (In-review)
